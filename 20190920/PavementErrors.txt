23		framingCost =...			replaced cementCost with framingCost
26		int perimeter = 2*length + 2*width;	replaced - with +	
32		...perimeter*framingCost);		replaced + with *

test case:
input length and width of 10 with 
cementCost and framing Cost of 2 and 3, respectively

expected:
area=100
perimeter=40
total cement cost=200
total framing cost=120

actual (prior to modification):
area=100
perimeter=0
total cement cost=300
total framing cost=0

After modification, we obtained the expected results.
